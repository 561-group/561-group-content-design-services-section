# Photograph treatment

Photography reproduced as evidence.
The documentary register of the bible's [two registers](../../../../glossary/terms/two-registers.md) of imagery.
Three reproduction treatments are permitted, each operationalized as a morphism.

## Treatment A — Duotone

Two inks, ground in paper.
[Ink](ink.md) + [witness-blue](witness-blue.md) for documentary subjects; [ink](ink.md) + [alarm-red](alarm-red.md) permitted only when alarm reading is part of the argument.
Halftone screen 65 lpi for newsprint, 100 lpi for offset, 133 lpi for fine offset.
Compress tonal range to the medium; do not chase shadow detail the press cannot hold.

See [duotone-treatment morphism](../procedures/duotone-treatment.md).

## Treatment B — Line-screen

Single ink, horizontal or vertical line screen, 25–45 lines per inch.
Use for newsprint at small scale and for any photograph reproduced in alarm (alarm halftones become illegible).

See [line-screen-treatment morphism](../procedures/line-screen-treatment.md).

## Treatment C — Dot-screen

Single ink, coarse dot screen, 20–35 lines per inch.
Use at poster scale where the dot itself is part of the read at distance.

See [dot-screen-treatment morphism](../procedures/dot-screen-treatment.md).

## Forbidden

- Four-color process.
  The bible refuses four-color reproduction of photographs in any context.
- Any color cast outside the system inks ([ink](ink.md), [bone](bone.md), [alarm-red](alarm-red.md), [witness-blue](witness-blue.md)).
- Filters, "instant" presets, simulated film grain.
- Vignettes.
- Burned or dodged edges beyond the photographer's print.
- Cropping that changes meaning.
  The photograph crops to the [grid](document-grid-print.md)'s columns; the crop may not omit information whose absence changes what the figure asserts.
- AI-generated imagery — see [no-ai-generated-imagery theorem](../561-group-design-bible-v0.3.html#s09).
- Display type set over the photograph — see [no-type-set-over-photography theorem](../561-group-design-bible-v0.3.html#s09).

## Frame

The [grid](../../../../glossary/terms/grid-system.md) governs the frame.
Photographs crop to grid columns.
A photograph that wants to bleed past the column boundary triggers a [grid-break](../procedures/grid-break.md), which is permitted at most once per document and must be documented in the [colophon](colophon-stamp.md).

## Caption

Every photograph carries a [caption-block](caption-block.md) with all five fields populated where possible: what, who, where, when, source / rights.
The *source / rights* field is non-optional for photography; an uncredited photograph is a defect.

The bible governs only how each photograph is reproduced — not who, when, or whether.
Sourcing, rights, and consent are organizational concerns, not visual ones, and live in 561's operating documents.
